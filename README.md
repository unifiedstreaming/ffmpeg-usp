Unified Streaming fork of FFmpeg README
=======================================

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) is a collection of libraries and tools to process
multimedia content such as audio, video, subtitles and related metadata.

This repository contains a fork of the FFmpeg sources, with customizations used
by [Unified Streaming](https://www.unified-streaming.com/):

* Added shell scripts for creating LGPLv2.1 builds of FFmpeg with gcc/clang and
  msvc
* Added jamfile.v2 for building with [b2](https://www.bfgroup.xyz/b2/)
* Renamed upstream `README.md` to `README-upstream.md`
